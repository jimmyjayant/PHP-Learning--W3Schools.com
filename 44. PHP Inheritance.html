        <h2>
            PHP - What is Inheritance? 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class. 
            <br>
            The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods. 
            <br>
            An inherited class is defined by using the <span class="edit">extends</span> keyword. 
            <br>
            Let's look at an example. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 1.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <b>Example Explained</b>
            <br>
            The Strawberry class is inherited from the Fruit class. 
            <br>
            This means that the Strawberry class can use the public $name and $color properties as well as the public __construct() and intro() methods from the Fruit class because of inheritance. 
            <br>
            The Strawberry class also has its own method: message(). 
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP - Inheritance and the Protected Access Modifier 
        </h2>

        <div>
            In the previous chapter we learned that <span class="edit">protected</span> properties or methods can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class. What does that mean? 
            <br>
            Let's look at an example. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 2.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            In the example above we see that if we try to call a <span class="edit">protected</span> method (intro()) from outside the class, we will receive an error. <span class="edit">public</span> methods will work fine! 
            <br>
            Let's look at another example. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 3.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            In the example above we see that all works fine! It is because we call the <span class="edit">protected</span> method (intro()) from inside the derived class. 
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP - Overriding Inherited Methods 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Inherited methods can be overridden by redefining the methods (use the same name) in the child class. 
            <br>
            Look at the example below. The __construct() and intro() methods in the child class (Strawberry) will override the __construct() and intro() methods in the parent class (Fruit). 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 4.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP - The final Keyword 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">final</span> keyword can be used to prevent class inheritance or to prevent method overriding. 
            <br>
            The following example shows how to prevent class inheritance. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 5.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            The following example shows how to prevent method overriding. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="44. PHP Inheritance-Example 6.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>
