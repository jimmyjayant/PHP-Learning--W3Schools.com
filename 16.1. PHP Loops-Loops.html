        <div>
            Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops. 
            <br>
            Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true. 
            <br>
            In PHP, we have the following loop types: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="edit">while</span> - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true</li>
                <li><span class="edit">do...while</span> - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true</li>
                <li><span class="edit">for</span> - loops through a block of code a specified number of times</li>
                <li><span class="edit">foreach</span> - loops through a block of code for each element in an array</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type.
