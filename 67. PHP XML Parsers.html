        <h2>
            What is XML? 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The XML language is a way to structure data for sharing across websites. 
            <br>
            Several web technologies like RSS Feeds and Podcasts are written in XML. 
            <br>
            XML is easy to create. It looks a lot like HTML, except that you make up your own tags.

        <h2>
            What is an XML Parser? 
        </h2>

        <div>
            To read and update, create and manipulate an XML document, you will need an XML parser. 
            <br>
            In PHP there are two major types of XML parsers: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Tree-Based Parsers</li>
                <li>Event-Based Parsers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            Tree-Based Parsers 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Tree-based parsers holds the entire document in Memory and transforms the XML document into a Tree structure. It analyzes the whole document, and provides access to the Tree elements (DOM). 
            <br>
            This type of parser is a better option for smaller XML documents, but not for large XML document as it causes major performance issues. 
            <br>
            Example of tree-based parsers: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>SimpleXML</li>
                <li>DOM</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            Event-Based Parsers 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Event-based parsers do not hold the entire document in Memory, instead, they read in one node at a time and allow you to interact with in real time. Once you move onto the next node, the old one is thrown away. 
            <br>
            This type of parser is well suited for large XML documents. It parses faster and consumes less memory. 
            <br>
            Example of event-based parsers: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>XMLReader</li>
                <li>XML Expat Parser</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
