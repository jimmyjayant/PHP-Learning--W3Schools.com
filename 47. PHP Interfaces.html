        <h2>
            PHP - What are Interfaces? 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement. 
            <br>
            Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism". 
            <br>
            Interfaces are declared with the <span class="edit">interface</span> keyword. 
            <br>
            <b>Syntax</b>
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             &lt;?php
             <br>
             interface InterfaceName {
                <br>
                public function someMethod1();
                <br>
                public function someMethod2($name, $color); 
                <br>
                public function someMethod3() : string;
                <br>
             }
             <br>
             ?&gt;

        <h2>
            PHP - Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Interface are similar to abstract classes. The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are:- 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can</li>
                <li>All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected</li>
                <li>All methods in an interface are abstract, so they cannot be implemented in code and the abstract keyword is not necessary</li>
                <li>Classes can implement an interface while inheriting from another class at the same time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP - Using Interfaces 
        </h2>

        <div>
            To implement an interface, a class must use the <span class="edit">implements</span> keyword. 
            <br>
            A class that implements an interface must implement <strong>all</strong> of the interface's methods. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="47. PHP Interfaces-Example 1.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            From the example above, let's say that we would like to write software which manages a group of animals. There are actions that all of the animals can do, but each animal does it in its own way. 
            <br>
            Using interfaces, we can write some code which can work for all of the animals even if each animal behaves differently. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="47. PHP Interfaces-Example 2.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <b>Example Explained</b>
            <br>
            Cat, Dog and Mouse are all classes that implement the Animal interface, which means that all of them are able to make a sound using the <span class="edit">makeSound()</span> method. Because of this, we can loop through all of the animals and tell them to make a sound even if we don't know what type of animal each one is. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since the interface does not tell the classes how to implement the method, each animal can make a sound in its own way.
