            File handling is an important part of any web application. You often need to open and process a file for different tasks.

        <h2>
            PHP Manipulating Files 
        </h2>

        <div>
            PHP has several functions for creating, reading, uploading, and editing files. 
            <br>

            <p class="edit1">
                <strong>
                    Be careful when manipulating files! 
                </strong>
                <br>
                When you are manipulating files you must be very careful. 
                <br>
                You can do a lot of damage if you do something wrong. Common errors are: editing the wrong file, filling a hard-drive with garbage data, and deleting the content of a file by accident. 
            </p>

        <h2>
            PHP readfile() Function 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">readfile()</span> function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer. 
            <br>
            Assume we have a text file called "28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt", stored on the server, that looks like this. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
             <br>
             CSS = Cascading Style Sheets
             <br>
             HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language 
             <br>
             PHP = PHP Hypertext Preprocessor 
             <br>
             SQL = Structured Query Language 
             <br>
             SVG = Scalable Vector Graphics 
             <br>
             XML = EXtensible Markup Language 
            </p>

            <br>
            The PHP code to read the file and write it to the output buffer is as follows (the <span class="edit">readfile()</span> function returns the number of bytes read on success). 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="28. PHP File Handling-Example 1.php" height="200" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            The <span class="edit">readfile()</span> function is useful if all you want to do is open up a file and read its contents.
