        <div>
            In this chapter we will teach you how to create and write to a file on the server. 
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP Create File - fopen() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fopen()</span> function is also used to create a file. Maybe a little confusing, but in PHP, a file is created using the same function used to open files. 
            <br>
            If you use <span class="edit">fopen()</span> on a file that does not exist, it will create it, given that the file is opened for writing (w) or appending (a). 
            <br>
            The example below creates a new file called "testfile.txt". The file will be created in the same directory where the PHP code resides. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             $myfile = fopen("testfile.txt", "w"); 
            </p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP File Permissions 
        </h2>

        <div>
            If you are having errors when trying to get this code to run, check that you have granted your PHP file access to write information to the hard drive. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP Write to File - fwrite() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fwrite()</span> function is used to write to a file. 
            <br>
            The first parameter of <span class="edit">fwrite()</span> contains the name of the file to write to and the second parameter is the string to be written. 
            <br>
            The example below writes a couple of names into a new file called "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt".  
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="30. PHP File Create Write-Example 1.php" height="50" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            Notice that we wrote to the file "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt" twice. Each time we wrote to the file we sent the string $txt that first contained "John Doe" and second contained "Jane Doe". After we finished writing, we closed the file using the <span class="edit">fclose()</span> function. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If we open the "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt" file it would look like this: 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             John Doe
             <br>
             Jane Doe 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP Overwriting 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Now that "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt" contains some data we can show what happens when we open an existing file for writing. All the existing data will be ERASED and we start with an empty file. 
            <br>
            In the example below we open our existing file "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt", and write some new data into it. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="30. PHP File Create Write-Example 2.php" height="50" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            If we now open the "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt" file, both John and Jane have vanished, and only the data we just wrote is present. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey;padding:2rem;">
             Mickey Mouse 
             <br>
             Minnie Mouse 
            </p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP Append Text 
        </h2>

        <div>
            You can append data to a file by using the "a" mode. The "a" mode appends text to the end of the file, while the "w" mode overrides (and erases) the old content of the file. 
            <br>
            In the example below we open our existing file "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt", and append some text to it. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="30. PHP File Create Write-Example 3.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>

            If we now open the "30. PHP File Create Write-newfile.txt" file, we will see that Donald Duck and Goofy Goof is appended to the end of the file. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             Mickey Mouse
             <br>
             Minnie Mouse
             <br>
             Donald Duck
             <br>
             Goofy Goof 
            </p>
        </div>
