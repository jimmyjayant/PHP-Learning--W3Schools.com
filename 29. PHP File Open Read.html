        <div>
            In this chapter we will teach you how to open, read, and close a file on the server.

        <h2>
            PHP Open File - fopen() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            A better method to open files is with the <span class="edit">fopen()</span> function. This function gives you more options than the <span class="edit">readfile()</span> function. 
            <br>
            We will use the text file, "28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt", during the lessons. 
            <br>

            The first parameter of <span class="edit">fopen()</span> contains the name of the file to be opened and the second parameter specifies in which mode the file should be opened. The following example also generates a message if the fopen() function is unable to open the specified file. 
            <br>
            Example:-

            <strong>Tip: </strong>The <span class="edit">fread()</span> and the <span class="edit">fclose()</span> functions will be explained below! 
            <br>
            The file may be opened in one of the following modes: 
            <br>
            <br>
            <table class="table1">
                <tr>

                        Erases the contents of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. File pointer starts at the beginning of the file

                        The existing data in file is preserved. File pointer starts at the end of the file. Creates a new file if the file doesn't exist 
                    </td>

        <h2>
            PHP Read File - fread() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fread()</span> function reads from an open file. 
            <br>
            The first parameter of <span class="edit">fread()</span> contains the name of the file to read from and the second parameter specifies the maximum number of bytes to read. 
            <br>
            The following PHP code reads the "28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt" file to the end. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             fread($myfile, filesize("28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt"));

        <h2>
            PHP Close File - fclose() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fclose()</span> function is used to close an open file. 
            <br>
            <p class="edit1">
                It's a good programming practice to close all files after you have finished with them. You don't want an open file running around on your server taking up resources! 
            </p>
            <br>
            The <span class="edit">fclose()</span> requires the name of the file (or a variable that holds the filename) we want to close. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey;padding:2rem;">
             &lt;?php 
             <br>
             $myfile = fopen("28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt","r"); 
             <br>
             // some code to be executed 
             <br>

        <h2>
            PHP Read Single Line - fgets() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fgets()</span> function is used to read a single line from a file. 
            <br>
            The example below outputs the first line of the "28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt" file. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="29. PHP File Open Read-Example 2.php" height="100" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <strong>Note: </strong>After a call to the <span class="edit">fgets()</span> function, the file pointer has moved to the next line. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP Check End-Of-File - feof() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">feof()</span> function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached. 
            <br>
            The <span class="edit">feof()</span> function is useful for looping through data of unknown length. 
            <br>
            The example below reads the "28. PHP File Handling-webdictionary.txt" file line by line, until end-of-file is reached. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="29. PHP File Open Read-Example 3.php" height="500" width="100%"></iframe>

        <h2>
            PHP Read Single Character - fgetc() 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">fgetc()</span> function is used to read a single character from a file. 
            <br>
            The example below reads the "webdictionary.txt" file character by character, until end-of-file is reached. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="29. PHP File Open Read-Example 4.php" height="200" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
