            Comments in PHP 
        </h2>

        <div>
            A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read only by someone who is looking at the code. 
            <br>
            Comments can be used to: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Let others understand your code</li>
                <li>Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            PHP supports several ways of commenting: 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <b><u>Syntax for single-line comments: </u></b>
            <br>
            <iframe src="5. PHP Comments - Single Line Comment.php" height="20" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <b><u>Syntax for multiple-line comments: </u></b>
            <br>
            <iframe src="5. PHP Comments - Multiple Line Comment.php" height="50" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <b><u>Using comments to leave out parts of the code: </u></b>
