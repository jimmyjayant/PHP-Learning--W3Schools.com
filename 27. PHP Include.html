        <div>
            The <span class="edit">include</span> (or <span class="edit">require</span>) statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include statement. 
            <br>
            Including files is very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text on multiple pages of a website. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP include and require Statements 
        </h2>

        <div>
            It is possible to insert the content of one PHP file into another PHP file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement. 
            <br>
            <strong>
                The include and require statements are identical, except upon failure: 
            </strong>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="edit">require</span> will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script</li>
                <li><span class="edit">include</span> will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>
            So, if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the include file is missing, use the include statement. Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your application's security and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing. 
            <br>
            Including files saves a lot of work. This means that you can create a standard header, footer, or menu file for all your web pages. Then, when the header needs to be updated, you can only update the header include file. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Syntax</b>
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             include '<i>filename</i>'; 
             <br>
             <br>
             or 
             <br>
             <br>
             require '<i>filename</i>';  
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>
            PHP include Examples 
        </h2>

        <div>
            <h3>
                Example 1
            </h3>

            Assume we have a standard footer file called "27. PHP Include-footer.php", that looks like this: 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             &lt;?php 
             <br>
             echo "&lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; 1999-" . date("Y") . " W3Schools.com&lt;/p&gt;"; 
             <br>
             ?&gt; 
            </p>

            <br>
            To include the footer file in a page, use the <span class="edit">include</span> statement. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="27. PHP Include-Example 1.php" height="200" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <br>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <h3>
            Example 2
        </h3>

        <div>
            Assume we have a standard menu file called "27. PHP Include-menu.php". 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             &lt;?php
             <br>
             echo '&lt;a href="/default.asp"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; - 
             <br>
             &lt;a href="/html/default.asp"&gt;HTML Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; - 
             <br>
             &lt;a href="/css/default.asp"&gt;CSS Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; - 
             <br>
             &lt;a href="/js/default.asp"&gt;JavaScript Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; - 
             <br>
             &lt;a href="default.asp"&gt;PHP Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;'; 
             <br>
             ?&gt; 
            </p>

            <br>
            All pages in the Web site should use this menu file. Here is how it can be done (we are using a &lt;div&gt; element so that the menu easily can be styled with CSS later). 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="27. PHP Include-Example 2.php" height="200" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h3>
            Example 3 
        </h3>

        <div>
            Assume we have a file called "vars.php", with some variables defined. 
            <br>
            <p style="border:0.1rem solid grey; padding:2rem;">
             &lt;?php
             <br>
             $color = 'red';
             <br>
             $car = 'BMW'; 
             <br>
             ?&gt; 
            </p>

            <br>
            Then, if we include the "27. PHP Include-vars.php" file, the variables can be used in the calling file. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="27. PHP Include-Example 3.php" height="200" width="100%"></iframe>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            PHP include vs. require 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">require</span> statement is also used to include a file into the PHP code. 
            <br>
            However, there is one big difference between include and require; when a file is included with the <span class="edit">include</span> statement and PHP cannot find it, the script will continue to execute. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="27. PHP Include-Example 4.php" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>
            <br>
            If we do the same example using the <span class="edit">require</span> statement, the echo statement will not be executed because the script execution dies after the <span class="edit">require</span> statement returned a fatal error. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <iframe src="27. PHP Include-Example 5.php" height="300" width="100%"></iframe>

            <br>

            <p class="edit1">
                Use <span class="edit">require</span> when the file is required by the application. 
                <br>
                Use <span class="edit">include</span> when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found. 
            </p>
        </div>
